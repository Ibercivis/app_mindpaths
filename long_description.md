What is the perceived relation between words?
This is still a complex issue for semantic specialists. The Mind Paths experiment uses a video-game in order to create a semantic map         where volunteers define the distances between words. Semantic                analysis is a major challenge for science and innovation as it's a           complex task requiring advanced models and experts validations.

Start selecting which words lead from one fixed starting word                    to the goal word to create a visual map of distance between words.           The results of this research will be important for the scientific as well    as the business world with lots of applications being based on               semantic analysis.

Since the work by Quillian in the late ‘60s, the view of                          semantic memory as a networked structure has provided a valuable             collection of scientific results. As the scientific community has            learned what such network looks like (its structural features), the          interest is shifting towards understanding how this structure is used        (the dynamics on it). Of course, processes on semantic networks can          be (and have been) simulated via "synthetic" dynamics, such        as random walks (see Borge-Holthoefer, J. and Arenas, A. (2010)              "Categorizing words through semantic memory navigation&",           EPJB, 74(2), 265). But we have few empirical evidence of how humans          actually navigate their "semantic landscape".  
                                                                                  
This is where Citizen Science comes in. Capitalizing on a previous,          small-scale experiment (see Beckage, N. et al. (2009) "Route            choice in individuals-semantic network navigation", Proc. 34thAn. Conf. Cognitive Science Society, 108), Mind Paths                 promoted from the [Cosnet Lab](http://cosnet.bifi.es/) — intends to collect data from subjects around the world      regarding their strategies to navigate the semantic landscape. In Mind    Paths, for a given Source and a Target, volunteers are asked to  build a path of intermediate words that connect them.                        
                                                                                 

In the long run, the obtained data (which is publicly                             available, as that is the philosophy underlying the concept of               Citizen Science) will help scholars to understand what sort of               heuristics we exploit to efficiently manage our intricate structure          of concepts.
